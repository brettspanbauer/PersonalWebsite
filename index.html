                <p>Hello! My name is Brett Spanbauer. I am a rising senior at Michigan Technological University, set to graduate in April of 2025. Upon graduating in the spring, I hope to work as an embedded software engineer.
                    I love anything that has to do with sports and fitness, and I love trying to learn new skills. I love being out on the lake in the summer, and as you can see on the right, I love wakesurfing. Growing up, I was
                    always in some sort of sport, whether that be football, basketball, or baseball. I love the competitive nature of sports, and I love that they help keep me in shape. This website was made to be an avenue to
                    further introduce myself to future employers, and put a face to my name! Some of the things I have worked on and my qualifications are explained in the other sections of this website. Thank you for checking it out!
                </p>

                <h1>Internship Experience</h1>
                <h2>Navico Group - Electrical Engineering Intern, Power Systems</h2>
                <h3>MATLAB Experience</h3>
                <p>I developed different MATLAB scripts to automate some of the data processing from the battery cell tests to save my coworkers
                    tons of time and effort. The scripts that were developed were easy and efficient to use. The scripts could accept any number of .csv or
                    .txt files, processes them in the way that was desired (including calculating models to fit the data), and output graphical and table 
                    formatted data to be used in testing reports. These scripts saved my coworkers from having to manually input their data into Excel worksheets
                    and manually filter the values to get the graphs and tables that were desired.
                </p>
                <h3>Robot Framework Experience</h3>
                <p></p>
                <h3>Battery Teardowns and Analysis Experience</h3>
                <p></p>
                <h2>Lumbermen's Inc. - IT/Programming Intern</h2>
                <h3>Python Experience</h3>
                <p>I maintained and added to an in-house web application that was built using the Django Framework. I fixed small bugs that were discovered throughout the summer,
                    and added some additional fields into the forms that were being used by the application.
                </p>
                <h3>SQL Experience</h3>
                <p>Our in-house web applications were attached to a SQL server. This server was used to store reports and other significant data that was input from the web
                    application. I learned how the Django Framework leverages a server to simplify the processing of pulling data out, and putting data in.
                    Along with this, I also learned to embed SQL code into SQL Server Reporting Services from Microsoft (SSRS). I was given the task of finding a new way to generate invoices
                    for audits, as our current server at the time was old and outdated, which caused a security risk. All the data from the old server was pushed into a SQL
                    database, and my job was to find a way to get that data out when a coworker or auditor needed it. Using SSRS, I developed an application where a coworker
                    could enter the site, input some fields to find the invoice they were looking for, and get an invoice out that they could save and do whatever they needed
                    with it. This was accomplished by embedding SQL queries into the reports that I made.
                </p>
                <h3>Service Experience</h3>
                <p>Along with the projects that I was working on throughout the summer, I was also on the phones answering IT help desk calls. I was one of three employees who were
                    on the help desk at all times. I started out shadowing calls, but after a couple weeks, I was first in the queue to answer phone calls from fellow employees who
                    needed help. This service taught me quick critical thinking. It also taught me how to explain things that I've learned about in school, that someone who is
                    not a computer person might not understand as well as I do.
